Symbols:
  &  = And
  |  = Or
  -  = Not
  -> = Implication
  =  = Biconditional Implication

Operator precedence is (Wikipeida says the last three are different on compilers so
I just want to make it explicit what the program is expecting)
1: Not
2: And
3: Or
4: Implication
5: Biconditional Implication

Statements must be on separate lines
Example:
p->r
s->t
a & b

Are considered 3 different statements and valid by the program
a&b p->r s->t
is considered invalid by the program because it looks at it as one statement

Program takes two arguments:
  Argument 1 is the hypothesis file -- the hypothesis file can be empty
  Argument 2 is the goals file
